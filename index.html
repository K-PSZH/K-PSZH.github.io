            <p>Danganronpa (Japanese: ダンガンロンパ) is a Japanese video game franchise created by Kazutaka Kodaka and developed and owned by Spike Chunsoft (formerly Spike).
            <br>The series primarily surrounds various groups of apparent high-school students who are forced into murdering each other by a robotic teddy bear named Monokuma.
            <br>Gameplay features a mix of adventure, visual novel, detective and dating simulator elements. The first game, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2010.
            <br>The original scenario was written by Kodaka, who aimed to create a dark adventure game. The original concept was rejected for being too gruesome, but it was later approved after retooling.
            <br>The series has morphed into a franchise that includes manga, anime, and novels. The franchise became one of Spike's most successful works since they previously outsourced their works.
            <br>The series received many positive reviews from critics, praising the series' characters, tone, and atmosphere. Rui Komatsuzaki's character designs became popular for cosplay.
            <br>Kodaka's work also inspired staff members from the studio Pierrot in the making of an anime titled Akudama Drive. By 2021, the Danganronpa series reached 5 million copies sold worldwide.</p>

            <p>The series revolves around an elite high school, Hope's Peak Academy, talented high school students who are at the top of their field, along with one "Ultimate Lucky Student" who is chosen by lottery.
            <br>The three games, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (2010), Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (2012), and Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony (2017) have similar premises.
            <br>Sixteen talented students who stand out in different fields are trapped by a bear-like machine, Monokuma. Monokuma traps the cast into killing games.
            <br>The cast is trapped for the rest of their lives in an establishment and the only way to return home is by killing another person and avoiding being found guilty during the class trials.
            <br>The video games's narratives are connected by related media, expanding the story between titles.</p>

            <br>Following the Japanese release of Danganronpa 1-2 Reload, a PlayStation Vita port of the game and its sequel, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, NIS America released the Vita version of Trigger Happy Havoc in February 2014.
            <br>Spike Chunsoft later released the game on Steam in February 2016. NIS America also released Danganronpa 1-2 Reload for PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe in March 2017, and Japan on May 18, 2017.
            <br>Another compilation for the Nintendo Switch titled Danganronpa Decadence was released in 2021. Besides the trilogy, the compilation offered a new title called
            <br>Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp, expanded from the two extra modes of Danganronpa V3.
            <br>The spin-off, Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls, takes place between the events of the first two games, follows Makoto's younger sister, Komaru Naegi, accompanied by Toko Fukawa,
            <br>as both of them trek through a city overrun by murderous Monokumas, and fighting against a group of children calling themselves the Warriors of Hope.</p>

            <p>Gameplay in the main Danganronpa games is split into six chapters which each have three sections: Daily Life, Deadly Life, and Class Trial.
            <br>Daily Life follows a standard visual novel style as players explore the school grounds, converse with characters, and progress the story.
            <br>During designated "Free Time" sections, players can interact with a character of their choice, learning more about them and earning new skills that can help them in the Class Trial.
            <br>Deadly Life is the post-murder investigation part of the story, in which players search for clues and gather evidence for the Class Trial.
            <br>The Class Trial is the main section of the series, in which the students attempt to determine the culprit. This involves various types of mini-games, the most common of which is the Nonstop Debate.
            <br>Here, the characters discuss the case in real-time, and the player must spot contradictions in their statements and shoot them using "Truth Bullets" containing the corresponding evidence.
            <br>Other minigames include Hangman's Gambit, with the goal being to shoot letters to spell out a clue, Bullet Time Battle(1)/Panic Talk Action(2)/Argument Armament(V3) has the player
            <br>using rhythmic button presses to argue against a character, and Closing Argument, which has the player piece together comic strips depicting the events of a murder.</p>
